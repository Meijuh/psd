\section{Design goals}
The importance of particular quality criteria depend on in which environment the application is
used. This environment also influences the stakeholders; not every categorie stakeholder is affected
by the software system. We offer our system open sourced and free of charge
online.\footnote{https://github.com/Meijuh/psd}. We assume the application is a highly popular one
and is us used among many people. We identify the most important quality criteria for this
environment as \emph{extensibility} and \emph{reusability}. The most affected stakeholders are the
\emph{developers}, \emph{maintainers}, \emph{testers} and \emph{users}.

Extensibility is an external criteria; it is most important for the user. Reusability are more
important for developers etc. Both criteria are also covered under the term modularity. Modularity
allow the user to easily use one of the many extensions, such as High Bohn or spin-offs, such as Al
Cabohne. It should be easy to implement such extensions for developers etc.
